Prerequisite Download and install Anaconda 3 before class.\nAnaconda 3 is a Python distribution which will be the compiler for our Python codes; We are going to use it to create virtual environment to ensure everybody in this class is on the same page; The version does not matter if we use virtual environment. I installed Anaconda3-2022.10-Windows-x86_64.exe for my Windows machine. For Windows PCs, you can set up a virtual environment following these steps: Open anaconda prompt, or alternatively, you can add anaconda to system path (the Windows environment variable). D:\\Programs\\anaconda3 D:\\Programs\\anaconda3\\Scripts D:\\Programs\\anaconda3\\Library\\bin After doing this, you can call python.exe and pip.exe in your command prompt (cmd.exe) Create a virtual environment python 3.10 under the name “main”: conda create -n main python=3.10 Type y to confirm downloading the packages and wait. Activate it conda activate main Now, if you run command pip install, the packages will be installed for this virtual environment pip install matplotlib pandas numba control dearpygui Open file explorer.exe at current directory explorer.exe . Create a file named my_dearpygui_demo.py and paste the following codes and save import dearpygui.dearpygui as dpg import dearpygui.demo as demo dpg.create_context() dpg.create_viewport(title=\u0026#39;Custom Title\u0026#39;, width=600, height=600) demo.show_demo() dpg.setup_dearpygui() dpg.show_viewport() dpg.start_dearpygui() dpg.destroy_context() Run python codes python my_dearpygui_demo.py Have fun! You can check existing virtual environment by typing: conda env list Jupyter notebook/lab Open cmd.exe and type jupyter lab. It will fire up jupyter lab in your default browser. I often use jupyter lab to do derivation verification and here is an example (you need to pip install sympy): from sympy import * from IPython.display import display, Latex # display result without need of print (matlab like) from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell; InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = \u0026#34;all\u0026#34; # use mathjax init_printing(use_latex=\u0026#39;mathjax\u0026#39;) # Define symbols t, p, a, b, c, d, e = symbols(\u0026#39;t, p, a, b, c, d, e\u0026#39;) L_σ = Symbol(r\u0026#39;L_\\sigma\u0026#39;) M_σ = Symbol(r\u0026#39;M_\\sigma\u0026#39;) i_alpha = Function(r\u0026#39;i_{\\alpha}\u0026#39;)(t) i_beta = Function(r\u0026#39;i_{\\beta}\u0026#39;)(t) i_abs = Matrix(2, 1, [i_alpha, i_beta]) Theta = Function(r\u0026#39;\\varTheta\u0026#39;)(t) Omega = Theta.diff(t) # Display stuff display(i_abs) display(Theta, Omega) a=100 a 100+a # Rotation Matrix P = Matrix(2,2, [ cos(Theta), sin(Theta), \\ -sin(Theta), cos(Theta)] ) P_inv = P.T # Full Park transformation (power invariant) T = sqrt(2/3)*Matrix(3,3, [ cos(Theta), cos(Theta-2*pi/3), cos(Theta-4*pi/3), -sin(Theta), -sin(Theta-2*pi/3), -sin(Theta-4*pi/3), 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] ) T_inv = T.T # Verify inverse equals transpose display(simplify(T*T_inv)) display(simplify(T_inv*T)) # Matrix Labcσs = Matrix(3,3, [L_σ, M_σ, M_σ, \\ M_σ, L_σ, M_σ, \\ M_σ, M_σ, L_σ] ) display(Labcσs) Ldqnσs = T * Labcσs * T_inv display(simplify(Ldqnσs)) # LaTeX latex(simplify(Ldqnσs)) ctrl+enter to execute and stay at current block. shift+enter to execute and move to next block.
