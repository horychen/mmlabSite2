We have four ongoing major projects. 
- bipedal robot
- maglev system and/or artificial heart
- four-wheel drive and in-wheel motor
- robot face that shows how robot feel
- leopard rotor that has a working waist
- flying hopper?

**A**
We are dying to know the essence of multi-contact motion of a bipedal robot.
We build contact sensor to enhance the perception to the environment.
We design model based controller that solves the motion of bipedal robot as an optimization problem.
We design mechanical legs that are backdrivable to make it possible to enable compliant walking/running. 

We build eddy current based displacement sensor for measuring the displacement of the maglev rotor.
We do electromagnetic design to get the "optimal" bearingless motor design that trades off between efficiency and suspension force.

We do iterative design of motor drives that cover power electronics from 600V 20A to 80V 120A. 
The network burden can be reduced using our four-in-one-drive.

We build robot face that helps man to understand robot's feeling.

Our lab is equipped with HBM 6-axis load cell (force sensor) and Yokogawa DL950 ScopeCorder.
We have two 4090 PC (one with intel CPU and one with AMD CPU).

We do BBQ when there is thundering in the near sky
